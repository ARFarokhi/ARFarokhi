<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Alireza Farokhi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></h1>

<p>For over 10 years my passion has been creating software applications for companies.</p>

<p>I've been honored to have participated in several successful projects as a <b>.NET Developer</b>. I've been working with profissional developers. But my work is not limited to creating Web Applications. I have a special passion for sharing my knowledge, so I spend part of my time training colleagues and writing articles about .net, microservices and system design .</p>

<p>Most of my ability to write code comes from my work with some of the best software development companies. I've had the privilege of coding with the best programming teams and gaining different knowledge for writing applications. I've used this distinction to deliver consistent positive results and help companies continually grow and develop.</p>
